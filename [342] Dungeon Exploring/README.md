# Dungeon Explorer

This game was made for Trijam \#342 with the theme "Dungeon Explorer".

For this game, I chose to create a simple 2d dungeon exploration game where the player navigates through a dungeon
, collecting coins and avoiding enemies. The visual style was a __retro 1-bit pixel art__ style.
